# Music_Analyzer
This is a music player and analyzer, that I built to learn about audio signals and GUI design using pygame.
Feel free to contribute if you would like to.
Features:
* Play mp3 files.
* Browse your filesystem and select the list of songs.
* Maintain a queue of songs to be played.
* Vizualize music.
